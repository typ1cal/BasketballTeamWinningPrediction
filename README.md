Built a KNN model using a value of k equals five, and then it's accuracy

An elbow graph for 15 values of K

Determined the minimum value for the parameter that improves results on validation data

Built a  model using Support Vector Machine

Trained a logistic regression model and determined the accuracy of the validation data (where C=0.01)

Calculated the F1 score and Jaccard Similarity score for each model from above. Use the Hyperparameter that performed best on the validation data
